You are free to add your plugins and themes to the site, just open a new PR.

- To add a plugin, you should edit `config/plugins/<category>.json` and add your plugin to **the end of** proper list.
- To add a theme, you should edit `config/themes/<category>.json` and add your plugin to **the end of** proper list.

If you believe you are building a powerful theme or plugin that is fittable with multiple categories, you can add it in multiple places.

Subdomain is not customizable, it should based on the name of your plugin/theme, generated by removing `@` `vuepress-` and replacing `/` with `-`, e.g.:

- `@org/vuepress-plugin-abc` will be `org-plugin-abc`
- `vuepress-theme-abc` will be `theme-abc`
